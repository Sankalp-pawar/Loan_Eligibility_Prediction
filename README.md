# Loan Eligibility Prediction 📊💰

This repository contains a machine learning project that predicts **loan eligibility** based on various applicant features. The project implements different ML models to determine whether an applicant is eligible for a loan.

## 📌 Project Overview
The goal of this project is to predict if a loan applicant is eligible for approval based on personal and financial details like income, credit history, and property area.

## 🏗️ Tech Stack
- **Programming Language:** Python 🐍
- **Libraries:** Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Models Used:** Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Naive Bayes, SVM, KNN

## 📂 Dataset
- **Dataset Name:** `loan_data.csv`
- **Features Include:** Applicant Income, Loan Amount, Credit History, Education, Property Area, and more.
- **Target Variable:** Loan Status (Approved/Not Approved)

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
